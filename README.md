# surveil
Surveillance and notification system for Raspberry Pi

### About

The surveillance system in this repository is based on the tutorial ["How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi (with Optional Coral USB Accelerator)"](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/blob/master/Raspberry_Pi_Guide.md) by [EdjeElectronics](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics).  The code in `TFLite_detection_webcam.py` comes directly from this tutorial but is slightly modified to save images and enable remote execution.
